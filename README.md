This is a simple maze game implemented in C. Players navigate through a maze using keyboard inputs and attempt to reach the exit while avoiding obstacles.

## Features

- **Player Movement**: Players can move up, down, left, or right within the maze using the keyboard inputs 'W', 'A', 'S', and 'D', respectively. They can also move four blocks to the right by pressing the spacebar.
- **Obstacle Avoidance**: Players must avoid colliding with obstacles represented by '#' symbols in the maze.
- **Game Over**: The game ends if the player collides with an obstacle or reaches the exit.
- **Win Condition**: Players win the game by reaching the exit marked by the 'O' symbol.

## Usage

1. **Compilation**: Compile the program using a C compiler such as GCC. For example:
    ```bash
    gcc main.c playerMovement.c -o maze_game
    ```
2. **Execution**: Run the compiled program:
    ```bash
    ./maze_game
    ```
3. **Main Menu**: Upon running the program, you will see a main menu with options to start a new game or exit.
4. **Game Rules**: If you choose to start a new game, the game rules will be displayed. Press Enter to start the game.
5. **Gameplay**: Use 'W', 'A', 'S', and 'D' to move the player up, left, down, and right, respectively. Press the spacebar to move four blocks to the right. Avoid collision with obstacles ('#') and reach the exit ('O') to win.
6. **Game Over**: If the player collides with an obstacle, the game will end, and you'll see a "Game Over" message. Press any key to return to the main menu.
7. **Win**: If the player reaches the exit, a "YOU WIN!!!" message will be displayed. Press any key to return to the main menu.
8. **Exit**: Choose the exit option from the main menu to quit the game.

## Files

- `main.c`: Contains the main function and game loop.
- `playerMovement.c`: Implements player movement and collision detection functions.
- `playerMovement.h`: Header file declaring function prototypes and constants.

## Notes

- The maze size and width can be adjusted by modifying the `Maze_Size` and `Maze_width` constants.
- For Unix-like systems, replace `system("cls")` with `printf("\033[2J \033[H")` in the code to clear the screen.
- This game does not have any graphical user interface and is played entirely using keyboard inputs and text-based output.

Enjoy playing the maze game! ðŸŽ®ðŸ§©
